The ambiance of social events is often filled with background music.
It is often difficult to achieve desired quality of such music at outdoor ad hoc events.
Smartphones, while widespread, lack the hardware to play audio at high volumes, without distortion.
Solutions such as wireless battery powered Bluetooth speakers do exist, but are far less common to have on your person.
We present an application allowing a network of smartphones to play audio synchronously, effectively increasing volume without degrading quality.

\bigskip \noindent
We investigate the scientific field related to human auditory perception, psychoacoustics.
Our research into psychoacoustics reveals a useful effect, the precedence effect, which amplifies perceived audio by manipulating playback of audio sources.
We also prove the existing solutions on the Play Store to be unsatisfactory, requiring manual trial and error efforts to achieve audible synchronization. 

\bigskip \noindent
To outperform existing solutions on the Play Store, we implement our own Android app.
We use a sample app as a framework to build upon, allowing us to disregard UI and focus on core technical aspects.
We replace the Android decoder and media player with our own, and implement a communication system using protobufs for efficient data transfer.
We utilize a global wall time and timestamped commands to synchronously execute commands.

\bigskip \noindent
We test our app, under the same circumstances as the apps on the Play Store.
The tests reveal that we have succeeded; our app outperforms those on the Play Store in regard to audible synchronization.
The app remains unpublished, due to need of usability polish.
