We first explore how to connect multiple Android devices into a network.
In \cnameref{sec:external_architectures} we decide that our external architecture should be a local centralized network, i.e.\ multiple slaves which each connect to the same master.
Then we present how the devices communicate through persistent connections.
Lastly, we discuss which data to send and how to transmit it.
