The purpose of this chapter is to describe the decisions, related to the implementation, 
we took in order to solve the milestones \ref{milestone:multidevice} and \ref{milestone:basic} in \cref{sec:milestones}.

Firstly, we decide how our devices communicate, in accordance with the chosen external architecture described in \cnameref{sec:external_architectures}.
Next we determine how to serialize the data and commands we want to send between multiple devices, and provide examples of the different data and commands we send.
Then we explain how we use these in conjunction in the app.
Lastly, we implement a way of synchronizing the clocks of the devices used in accordance with the decisions made in \cnameref{cha:synchronization}.
