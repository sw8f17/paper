The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of both the foundation of our app and how continuous integration fits into our development process.
This will lead into the following chapters in this part, where we present some obstacles we faced during development.
Furthermore, we discuss and compare possible solutions to these obstacles, and elaborate on how we implement the ones determined to be most appropriate.

These following chapters each address a group of related issues:

        How does Android handle playback of audio?\\
        How do we decode MP3 files on Android?\\
        How do we precisely control the playback of audio?
    \item[\cnameref{cha:communication}] \hfill\\
        How do we discover and connect nearby Android devices?\\
        How do we maintain a network of Android devices?\\
        How do we efficiently transmit data in said network?
    \item[\cnameref{cha:synchronization}] \hfill\\
        How do we ensure that all Android devices in the network are synchronized?\\
        How can we enforce near simultaneous execution of commands on all devices in the network?
