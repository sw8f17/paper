\chapter{State of The Art}\label{cha:sota}
In this chapter we look at solutions that are related to our initial problem statement and our aforementioned use case.
This includes both Android apps as well as other related solutions such as Multi--Room Audio systems.
We look specifically at Android apps as this is the type of phones we have access to, and as such are the most relevant for any potential solution we can come up with.
We analyze these solutions in order to identify not only potential issues and challenges we may face, but also to see where the current benchmark is on the market.
