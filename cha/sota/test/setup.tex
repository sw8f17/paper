\subsection{Setup}
Testing the offset between two audio sources is a signal processing
task. To make the signal processing easy and effective a clear signal is
needed. Additionally the signal needs to be synchronized between the
channels at recording time, since otherwise the analysis would be
mislead by desync in the recording. Luckily most computers include
a port for doing just that, a stereo microphone port.

The stereo microphone port in the test computer is a \ac{TRS} jack
connector, with a common ground between the two channels. To separate
the channels into separate mono tracks we used a \ac{TRS} to \ac{RCA}
splitter, and a custom \ac{RCA} to mono \ac{TS}, to capture the two
separate right\jjnote{Is it right} channels from
