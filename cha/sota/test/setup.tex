\subsection{Setup}
In order to perform these tests, we need to have a setup for it. 

Testing the offset between two audio sources is a signal processing
task. To make the signal processing easy and effective a clear signal is
needed. Additionally the signal needs to be synchronized between the
channels at recording time, since otherwise the analysis would be
mislead by desync in the recording. Luckily most computers include
a port for doing just that, a stereo microphone port.

The stereo microphone port in the test computer is a \ac{TRS} jack
connector, with a common ground between the two channels. To separate
the channels into separate mono tracks we used a \ac{TRS} to \ac{RCA}
splitter, and a custom \ac{RCA} to mono \ac{TS}, to capture the two
separate right\jjnote{Is it right} channels from

Furthermore we limit our tests to a master/slave/slave setup, 
that is; one phone acts as a master, and we perform the tests 
on two slaves connected to it. Since we are not able to test
using three channels as input to our computers. 

In the tests we use three Android phones:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Master: Moto X Style (Android 6.0)
	\item Slave 1: OnePlus One (Android a.b)
	\item Slave 2: OnePlus X (Android x.y)
\end{itemize}

The test itself will be performed in an automatic fashion using a Python script we wrote.
This ensure consistency and minimize the chances of error caused by humans.
