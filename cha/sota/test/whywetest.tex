The purpose of the testing section is to explore what the capabilities of the state of art is.
That is we want to identify some parameters, and test to what degree the state of art achieves them.

We have identified the following three categories to test:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Offset,
    \item Consistency,
    \item Drift.
\end{enumerate*}

Each of these are required for an app to fulfill the initial problem statement presented in \vref{sec:initial_problem}.
Moreover if the apps fail, to a certain degree, in any of the categories, then they are not fully suited as a solution for the problem at hand. 
Concretely we want to answer the following questions in each category:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Offset
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item Is the audio synchronized without any manual adjustment?
        \item Can the manual adjustment make them synchronized?
    \end{enumerate} 
    \item Consistency
    \begin{enumerate}[start=3,label=(\arabic*)]
        \item If the song changes are the synchronization preserved?
        %\item If a device disconnects and reconnects are the synchronization preserved?
        \item If a devices pauses the playback, is the synchronization consistent?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Drift
    \begin{enumerate}[start=6,label=(\arabic*)]
        \item Is the synchronization stable over time?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
