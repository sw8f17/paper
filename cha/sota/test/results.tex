\subsection{Results}
In this section we present the results of the tests.
The interpretation of these will come later.
\subsubsection{SoundSeeder}
First we tested the SoundSeeeder app, using the setup and methods listed previously. 
In \vref{fig:soundseeder_test} the results of the first test, using the slider to manually adjust the offset, is shown. 
A total of 115 datapoints were collected in the test.

In \vref{fig:soundseedersyncbutton} we test SoundSeeders synchronize button.
Each of the measurements is the median of five. 
Furthermore it should be note that the values were generally within $\pm 0.5 ms$ of each other.
