\chapter{Acceptance Test}\label{cha:acctest}
This chapter aims to test our application, in particular testing it in relation to the two apps which are similar to ours: AmpMe and SoundSeeder.
We have previously tested these, in \vref{sec:sota_test}, where we tested their offset, consistency and drift.
We test to see if we fulfilled the requirements we made in \vref{cha:requirement_elicitation} particularly: \ref{req:sync}, \ref{req:auto_off}, \ref{req:change_off}, \ref{req:pauseplay}, and \ref{req:drift}.
Also to see if we surpassed the milestone \ref{milestone:advanced_sync} we made in \vref{sec:milestones}.

In order to be fair we will test our app in the same way as we tested AmpMe and SoundSeeder, in order for them to be comparable.
Therefore the setup and procedure of this test will be the same as the one in \vref{sec:test_setup} and \vref{sec:test_procedure} respectively.

AmpMe and SoundSeeder both have manual sliders to adjust the synchronization on each device, however we do not have this as we rely on doing this automatically, therefor we cannot repeat the previous test for our app.
We will compare our automatic synchronization to the synchronization they do initially.

In total we will test the following questions from \vref{sec:sota_test} about our app:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the audio synchronized without any manual adjustment?
    \item Is the synchronization stable over time?
    \item Is the delay consistent between playbacks?
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

\begin{description}
    \item[Is the audio synchronized without any manual adjustment?] \hfill \\
        This question should be considered in relation to to the requirement \vref{req:auto_off}, which states that the offset should be lower than 40 ms between the devices.
        During our tests, as shown in \vref{fig:smus_drift_test} offset is generally much lower than that.
        The figure \vref{fig:smus_drift_test_nofilter} contains all the datapoints, there there are 6 data points which are clear outliers.
        They outliers in the results are likely due to glitches in our time synchronization and TCP congestion.
        In order to better shown the general synchronization over time we have \vref{fig:smus_drift_test_filtered}, where we show the points in the [50;-30] ms range.
        Here most the data points are within $20$ ms of perfect synchronization.

        Preventing the glitches will be part of our future work in \vref{cha:future_work}.
