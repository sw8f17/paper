\chapter{Development Method}\label{cha:development_method}
In this chapter we describe our development method.
This includes our use of Scrum, the milestones we created in \cnameref{sec:milestones} and how those two were used together.
We also mention our review structure as well as our approach to testing.
In \cnameref{sec:ci} our \ac{CI} was described, as such we only mention this briefly without going into details in this chapter.

%%%% Disposition %%%%

%How we use SCRUM
    %Roles
    %Sprints
    %PlanningPoker

%Milestones and how they work with SCRUM
    %Provided an early overview of the major steps required to reach our goal, and also provided goals out of our reach to show where the project could potentially go given enough time.
    %Not equivelant with sprints
    %Not really utilized that much in the end.

%CI and review structure
    %Ref CI chapter and focus on review structure
    %The use of github pull requests for review
    %Review requirements
        %we did not formalize any requirements this time, many pull requiests have only 1 reviewer, particularly in the application repo.

%Our Approach to testing
    %SOTA testing
        %Python Scripts
    %Testing our application
        %Smoke tests untill finished product essentially
        %Using the same tests as for SOTA to evaluate the our app vs sota apps
    %Testing during development
        %Can it build? pretty much it
        %Barely any tests during development afaik?
            %Time conversion math has been tested
            %Not really any testing beyond that other than smoke tets
                %Communication tests between two devices can not really be performed in the same style as unit tests
        %Uppaal used to solve an issue, could unit tests have helped here?
