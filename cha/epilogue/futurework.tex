\chapter{Future Work}\label{cha:future_work}
                                                %%%% Disposition %%%%
%Remaining Milestones
    %While we havnt really used milestones we still managed to come up with some good goals
    %Advanced sync & Offset manipulation
        %How would we obtain better sync? 
            %^Explore avenues which we didn't look at
                %Audio?
                %Any NTP algorithms of value we could utilise? Cache for validation to at least avoid the occasional huge offset? %TK: Replacing SNTP with NTP would be an obvious future work
    %Psychoacoustics could be under this section as well, would make sense per the milestones.

%Commercialising the Application
    %We are beating the market, lets commercialise
    %Stability
        %Crashes, join an existing session without crashing etc.
    %Scalability
        %Wi-Fi direct only supoports up to 8 devices.
            %May be fine for most cases but an increase would cover the festival use case scenario better, lots of people.
    %Usability - add as requirement rather than nonrequirement
        %Support Spotify (implicitly provides playlists, queue, etc.)
            %Request songs from master through spotify??(I have no idea how this would work but it would be neat)
    %TK: UI improvements!!!

%More Psychoacoustics
    %Many of the effects can only be used one at a time
        %Multiple modes
            %3D sound
                %Master as 3D target, wont play
            %Other effects of interest??
                %Just use 3D as main example and mention a bunch of others            
            %TK: Stereo (2.0) or even 5 speaker setup ?
