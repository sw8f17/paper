In this chapter we strive to determine both an external and internal architecture for the development of our solution.
The external architecture, could also be described as the network architecture, and cover the architecture of the orchestration of multiple devices;
while the internal architecture embodies how the intricate parts of the Android app should be structured and composed.

The architectures are abstractly presented and discussed, but will be reevaluated and elaborated upon in a later chapter regarding the concrete implementation.
