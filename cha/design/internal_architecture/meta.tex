In this chapter we present different options for internal architectures of our Android App.
We deem it important to choose an architecture, which will allow for extensibility, maintainability and testability.
All proposed internal architectures, will be evaluated in regard to how well these requirements are met, and lastly we choose an architecture to use in the implementation of our Android App.
