\chapter{Core Idea} % Better title?!?

The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of how we plan to solve the problem at hand.

% This time on: CORE IDEA

% Recap of what the goal is: 
	% Audio sync
		% Clock sync

The primary problem we are dealing with is the ability to perform commands and play sound synchronously.
That is, we need to have a way to execute a given action at once, on all devices.
Since we cannot expect the clocks on each Android phone to be in--sync, we need to find a way of relating their clock to a master clock. 

% What do we need then?
% Clock sync
% Precision audio (PCM)
% Communication over network
	% For data
	% For commands
