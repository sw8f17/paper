\chapter{Core Idea} % Better title?!?

The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of how we plan to solve the problem at hand.

% This time on: CORE IDEA

% Recap of what the goal is: 
	% Audio sync
		% Clock sync

The primary problem we are dealing with is the ability to perform commands and play sound synchronously.
That is, we need to have a way to execute a given action at once, on all devices.
Since we cannot expect the clocks on each Android phone to be in--sync, we need to find a way of relating their clock to a master clock. 

% What do we need then?
% Clock sync
% Precision audio (PCM)
% Communication over network
	% For data
	% For commands

The central concept of our idea to achieve synchronization and control is for the devices to have a common clock, and issue all commands with a timestamp for when the action is supposed to occur. 
This proposes several problems which would have to be resolved. 
Among these are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we connect the devices?
	\item How do we give the devices a common clock?
	\item How do we transmit audio?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Do we send the raw files to each device ahead of time?
		\item Do we send parts of files to each devices, in a streaming manner?
		\item Do we need to do some pre--computation on the audio before transmitting it?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
