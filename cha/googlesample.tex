%Music service and how it is controlled
    %Services, why a service, close app, connect controller, controller can be accessed from outside the app;
    %Cross device will use controller.
    %You have App --> controlled by service, acessable without the app open --> from any activity/service
    %This is why we make a sync service, which can acess controller.
%Providers, simply adding providers i.e. spotify in the future

\section{Googlesamples Media Player(WIP)}
%%%Meta%%%
    %This section describes our implementation and use of googlesamples media player, as a foundation for our app.
    %This work fulfills our first milestone <quote.milestone.one>, and produces a foundation for which we will continue with our next milestone <quote.milestone.two>
    %the googlesamples media player which we are using, is a large codebase, in this section we will be covering the elements and design choices that are used.
    %These choices are relevant as they decide how we will approach further development atop this code base, we use a code base like this such that we can focus on what is required in order to utilize multiple devices, rather than spending time developing a local media player.

%Basics
    %We have an activity(app??)
    %We utilize services such that we can control the activity without it being "active"(app open)
        %We have a musicservice at present, a communication service will come later to support cross device commands
    %Controllers are used to give the services commands (so what exactly is a controller?)

%Code stuff
    %Mainactivity  ---> Initializing the activity (app launcher) --> UI -> inherits from BaseActivity
    %Playback   ---> The code executed, pause, seek, etc.
        %This is what is controlled by the service calls???
    %Model ---> Media source access(we made external to access audio on device) --> relates to MusicProvider somehow
        %This is providers??


%Uncovered
    %MediaBrowser?, this is related to activity, mediabrowser updates UI? me
